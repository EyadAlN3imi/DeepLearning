I've Worked with Statlog (Vehicle Silhouettes) Dataset to classify vehicle types based on geometric and shape-based features derived from vehicle silhouettes. 
The goal is to predict one of four vehicle classes: Bus, Opel, Saab, and Van.

I've uploaded the data after I gathered and transformed the data into one CSV file you can find it with name "vehicle_data.csv"

*In the updated notebook I've added a residual layers and batch norm with initialization for the parameters
