This notebook demonstrates the process of training a deep learning model using EfficientNet-B0 on the FashionMNIST dataset.

Dependencies Installation:

The notebook begins by installing necessary libraries: torch, torchvision, matplotlib, and tqdm.
Data Preprocessing:

FashionMNIST images are resized to 224x224 pixels, converted from grayscale to 3-channel images, and transformed into tensors.
Model Setup:

The pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 model is loaded, and its classifier head is modified to output 10 classes for the FashionMNIST dataset.
Training:

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss, running for 10 epochs with progress displayed using tqdm.
Evaluation:

The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set, and the results are printed.
Prediction Visualization:

A function is implemented to visualize predictions on a sample of test images, displaying the predicted and actual labels.
This notebook serves as a basic example of using EfficientNet-B0 for image classification tasks, including model modification, training, evaluation, and visualization.
